# iOS Location Changer Renewer


This tool, Renewer.py, is designed to be used with ios-location-changer.exe. If you use the ios-location-changer.exe program without the Renewer.py, you are limited to only 2 trials. However, by using this Renewer.py script, you can renew the trials every time, giving you unlimited access to the program.



## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, make sure you have Python installed on your system.


## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1itsDani/iOS-Location-Changer-Renewer.git
```
Change into the project directory:

```
## Usage

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```javascript
cd ios-location-changer-renewer\Renewer.py
```
Run the script:

```javascript
python Renewer.py
```
The script will prompt you to run as an administrator. Make sure to run it as an administrator; otherwise, it won't work.
